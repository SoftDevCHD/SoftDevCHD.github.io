    </p>
    <h2>2. OUR SERVICES</h2>
    <p>
      The information provided when using the Services is not intended for
      distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or
      country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or
      regulation or which would subject us to any registration requirement
      within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose
      to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative
      and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the
      extent local laws are applicable.
    </p>
    <h2>3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
    <h3>Our intellectual property</h3>

      software, website designs, audio, video, text, photographs, and graphics
      in the Services (collectively, the "Content"), as well as the trademarks,
      service marks, and logos contained therein (the "Marks").
    </p>
    <p>
