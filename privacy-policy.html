    <h2>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
    <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>

      We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when

    </p>

    <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
    <p>
      We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or
      navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific
      identity but may include device and usage information, such as your IP
      address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
      preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information
      about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information.
    </p>

    <h2>2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p>
      We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending
      on how you interact with our Services, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage
        user accounts.
      </li>
      <li>To respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.</li>
      <li>To send administrative information to you.</li>
      <li>To enable user-to-user communications.</li>
      <li>To request feedback.</li>
      <li>To enforce our terms, conditions and policies.</li>
      <li>To protect our Services.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p>
      We may share information in specific situations described in this section
      and/or with the following third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may share and disclose your information in the following situations:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your
        information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger,
        sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of
        our business to another company.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Other Users.</strong> When you share personal information or
        otherwise interact with public areas of the Services, such personal
        information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made
        available outside the Services in perpetuity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
    <p>
      We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and
      pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we
      use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in
      our Cookie Notice: https://www.versytalks.com.
    </p>

    <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements).
    </p>

    <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
      organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
      personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
      efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
      Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
      secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
      other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security
      and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
    </p>

    <h2>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on where you are located geographically, the applicable privacy
      law may mean you have certain rights regarding your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some regions (like Canada), you have rights that allow you greater
      access to and control over your personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
      applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
      activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
      online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
      uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
      has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
      signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice
      not to be tracked online.
    </p>

    <h2>9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version
      will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version
      will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes
      to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a
      notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We
      encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of
      how we are protecting your information.
    </p>

      contact@versytalks.com.

    <h2>
      11. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?
    </h2>

      request access to the personal information we collect from you, change
      that information, or delete it. To request to review, update, or delete
